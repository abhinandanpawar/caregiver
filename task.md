# WAVES Platform UI Enhancement: Next Steps

## Summary of Completed Work (Task: Management Dashboard Overhaul)

The initial phase of the UI overhaul is complete. The Management Dashboard has been successfully refactored from a static HTML/JavaScript implementation into a modern, professional application using the following technology stack:
-   **React**
-   **TypeScript**
-   **Vite**
-   **Material-UI (MUI)**

The codebase for this new dashboard is located in `src/management_dashboard/`. All original features have been re-implemented as modular React components, and the project documentation (`README.md`) has been updated to reflect these changes.

**Critical Blocker:** A persistent and unresolvable issue with the sandbox environment (`getcwd` and `uv_cwd` errors) prevented the installation of dependencies and the running of the application servers. As a result, final verification and the generation of feature screenshots could not be completed. The code has been submitted based on its correctness against the plan and a successful code review.

## Next Task: Refactor the Personal Dashboard UI

**Objective:** To unify the platform's user experience and technology stack by refactoring the `Personal Dashboard` to match the modern architecture of the newly overhauled `Management Dashboard`.

The current Personal Dashboard, located in `src/agent_ui/`, is built with the Python-based **Bottle** framework. While functional, it is inconsistent with the new design language and technology direction of the platform. This next task will involve replacing it with a new React application.

### High-Level Plan:

1.  **Initialize a New React Project:**
    -   Create a new Vite-based React and TypeScript project within `src/agent_ui/`, replacing the existing Bottle application files.
    -   Set up the necessary dependencies, including MUI, to ensure consistency with the Management Dashboard.

2.  **Re-implement Core Features as React Components:**
    -   **Kanban Board:** Re-create the drag-and-drop Kanban board as an interactive React component. This will likely involve a library like `react-beautiful-dnd` or a modern equivalent.
    -   **Goal Setting & Tracking:** Refactor the goal management feature into a clean, user-friendly React component, using MUI components for forms, lists, and tracking elements.

3.  **Ensure Backend Integration:**
    -   The new React components must correctly fetch and update data by making API calls to the existing backend endpoints responsible for managing Kanban and goal data.

4.  **Verification and Documentation:**
    -   Assuming the environment issues are resolved, thoroughly test the new Personal Dashboard.
    -   Capture screenshots of the new UI and update the `README.md` to reflect the changes and include the new visuals.

By completing this task, both the management and personal dashboards will share a consistent, modern, and maintainable codebase, significantly improving the overall quality and user experience of the WAVES platform.

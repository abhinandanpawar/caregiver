# Project Status & Audit (Final State)

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the AI-Powered Employee Wellbeing Monitoring System as of the latest version. It details the current state of each component, outlines completed work, and clarifies the remaining tasks required to make the system fully operational.

## 1. Overall Summary

The project's foundational web interfaces and backend services are **complete and functional**. The user-facing applications (the Management Dashboard and the Agent UI) have been significantly enhanced, and the overall system architecture has been improved for better scalability and maintainability.

The core AI components, including model integration and the data processing pipeline, remain as placeholders and represent the next major phase of development. The project is currently in a state where the UIs and services are ready for these AI features to be integrated.

## 2. Component Breakdown

### 2.1. Management Dashboard

This component has been refactored into a data-driven application with its own dedicated backend API.

*   **Technology:** Basic React (from CDN), Chart.js, FastAPI (Python)
*   **Location:** `src/management_dashboard/`
*   **Status:** **Complete & Functional (with Placeholder Data)**
*   **Description:** A dynamic, single-page application that provides an interactive dashboard for managers.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Dedicated API Server:** A new `server.py` provides all data for the dashboard.
    *   **Data-Driven Components:** All UI components now fetch their data from the local API server.
    *   **Dynamic Data Visualizations:**
        *   A **bubble chart** visualizes department wellness (focus vs. burnout risk).
        *   A **line chart** displays wellness trends over time.

### 2.2. Agent UI (Employee-Facing Dashboard)

This is the lightweight, local dashboard for individual employees.

*   **Technology:** Bottle (Python)
*   **Location:** `src/agent_ui/`
*   **Status:** **Complete & Functional (with Placeholder Data)**
*   **Description:** A simple web interface that displays an employee's personal wellness metrics and allows them to configure their settings.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Dashboard:** Displays a personal wellness score and activity metrics (using placeholder data).
    *   **Data Transparency Page:** A static page explaining the data collection and privacy policies.
    *   **Functional Settings Page:** A new, fully functional page that allows users to configure data collection and notification levels. Settings are **persisted** to a `settings.json` file.

### 2.3. Central Analytics Hub (Data Ingestion Server)

This is the main server responsible for collecting data from all the individual agents.

*   **Technology:** FastAPI (Python)
*   **Location:** `src/server/`
*   **Status:** **Functional (Placeholder Implementation)**
*   **Description:** A simple API endpoint designed to receive anonymized data reports from the agents.
*   **Functionality:** The server currently only **logs the received data to the console**. It does not perform any processing, aggregation, or storage. This is a placeholder for the future data pipeline.

## 3. Key Missing Pieces (The AI Core)

The following components are the primary remaining tasks and are all related to the AI and data processing pipeline:

1.  **Dynamic Agent Data:** The local `agent_ui` needs to be connected to a process that generates real-time wellness data instead of using hardcoded values.
2.  **AI Model Integration:** The fine-tuned AI model needs to be integrated into the agent-side process to perform local inference on the collected behavioral data.
3.  **Data Aggregation Pipeline:** The central server needs a robust data pipeline to replace the current placeholder. This involves:
    *   Storing the incoming agent reports.
    *   Processing and aggregating the data.
    *   Saving the aggregated metrics to a database.
4.  **Connecting the Management Dashboard to Real Data:** The management dashboard's backend needs to be updated to query the new aggregation database instead of serving random placeholder data.

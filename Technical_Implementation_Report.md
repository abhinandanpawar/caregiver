## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed technical blueprint for the design, development, and deployment of the AI-Powered Employee Wellbeing Monitoring System. It is intended for engineering, product, and leadership stakeholders. This plan is based on the initial product vision and has been refined to meet the technical constraint of a **<150MB total installation footprint** for the client-side agent.

## 2. Clarifying Questions for Stakeholders

Before beginning development, it is crucial to align on the following points. This section is intended to elicit feedback from Product, Legal, and Leadership teams to ensure the final product meets all business, ethical, and compliance requirements.

### 2.1. For the Product & UX Team

1.  **Personal Dashboard Interactivity:**
    *   To what degree can an employee interact with their personal dashboard? Is it purely for viewing insights, or can they provide feedback on the accuracy of an insight (e.g., "This burnout prediction is inaccurate")?
    *   How should the agent handle conflicting user input? For example, if a user manually reports low stress, but the behavioral model detects high stress, which takes precedence?

2.  **Defining "Work-Related" Behavior:**
    *   The document states "Only work-related behavioral patterns collected." How do we technically define and differentiate "work-related" applications and websites from "personal" ones?
    *   Should there be a user-configurable list of applications to monitor? Or should this be centrally defined by the employer? What are the privacy implications of both?

3.  **Department-Specific Baselines:**
    *   How are new employees or employees who switch departments handled? How long should the "re-calibration" period be for establishing a new baseline?
    *   What happens when a department's nature of work fundamentally changes (e.g., a new project starts)? Is there a mechanism to trigger a manual or automatic re-baselining for the entire team?

### 2.2. For the Legal & Compliance Team

1.  **Data Processing and "Legitimate Interest":**
    *   Has a formal Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) been completed to validate "Legitimate Interest" as the legal basis for processing under GDPR? Can the engineering team review this document to ensure our technical implementation aligns perfectly?
    *   What are the specific data retention requirements for different types of data (e.g., raw behavioral events, aggregated insights, user feedback)? The report mentions a "90 days maximum," but does this apply to all data?

2.  **Anonymization Threshold:**
    *   The "minimum 5 employees for any insight" is a great starting point. However, could a combination of filters (e.g., "show me engineers with 2-4 years of experience on Project X") inadvertently de-anonymize individuals?
    *   Should we implement technical safeguards against such "query-based" de-anonymization attacks on the central dashboard?

3.  **Employee Rights (Right to Erasure):**
    *   When an employee exercises their "Right to Erasure," does this mean only deleting their personal data, or does it also require removing their anonymized data from the aggregated datasets? The latter has significant technical implications for historical trend analysis.

### 2.3. For Leadership & Management

1.  **"No Productivity Punishment" Rule:**
    *   How do we technically enforce the "wellness focus only, no productivity punishment" rule? For instance, if the system detects a pattern that indicates both low wellness *and* low productivity, how should this be presented to managers?
    *   What is the escalation path if an employee believes the tool is being used for punitive reasons? Is there an independent oversight function the agent can direct employees to?

2.  **Pilot Program Success Criteria:**
    *   What are the specific, measurable KPIs that will define a successful pilot program? Is it a certain level of model accuracy, a minimum employee opt-in rate, or a qualitative feedback score?

3.  **Third-Party Integrations:**
    *   The roadmap mentions integrating with HR software vendors. What kind of data would we be sharing with these platforms? Would this be aggregated data only, or are there scenarios where more specific (yet still anonymous) data would be required? This is critical for designing our API and data architecture from the start.

## 3. Technical Feasibility & Risk Analysis

This section assesses the viability of the project's technical goals and identifies potential risks and their mitigation strategies.

This section assesses the viability of the project's technical goals, identifies potential risks, and proposes concrete mitigation strategies. The analysis is based on the revised **<150MB installation footprint**.

### 3.1. Feasibility Analysis

#### 3.1.1. Target: <150MB Installation Footprint
**Conclusion: Feasible.** The 150MB target is achievable with careful engineering, a significant improvement from the high-risk <100MB goal.

**Proposed Size Budget:**
| Component                       | Target Size | Rationale                                                                                                                                                             |
|:--------------------------------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AI Model (Quantized Phi-3-mini)** | **~80 MB**  | A 4-bit quantized version of Phi-3-mini (3.8B parameters) can be compressed to this size. This provides a strong balance between performance and footprint.         |
| **Embedded Python & Runtime**   | **~35 MB**  | Using PyInstaller with a stripped-down Python version provides a robust, cross-platform executable. This size is typical for a bundled app with core libraries. |
| **Core AI/ML Libraries**        | **~25 MB**  | Includes essential libraries like `onnxruntime` or `ctransformers` for model inference, which are pre-compiled and optimized for size.                               |
| **Application & Utility Code**  | **~10 MB**  | Our own Python code, `psutil` for system metrics, a lightweight web server for the UI, configuration files, and UI assets (HTML/CSS/JS).                                |
| **Total Estimated Size**        | **~150 MB** | This budget is realistic and allows for a high-quality model and stable application runtime without requiring extreme, high-risk compression techniques.                 |

#### 3.1.2. Target: Hardware Performance (<300MB RAM, <1% CPU)
**Conclusion: Feasible, with conditions.** These targets are achievable during idle or passive monitoring states but will be exceeded during active analysis.

*   **RAM Usage (<300MB):**
    *   **Baseline:** The application itself will consume ~50-100MB of RAM.
    *   **Model Loading:** Loading the ~80MB model into memory will be the largest component. With memory mapping (`mmap`), we can keep the initial RAM hit low.
    *   **Peak Usage:** During active inference (analyzing text or behavior), RAM usage will likely spike to the **250-400MB** range. This is acceptable as it's temporary. The <300MB claim should be marketed as "average RAM footprint."
*   **CPU Usage (<1%):**
    *   **Passive Monitoring:** The agent will spend most of its time (~99%) in a passive state, collecting metrics from `psutil` or system APIs. This is extremely low-cost and will be well under 1% CPU usage.
    *   **Active Inference:** When the model runs an analysis (e.g., once every few minutes or on specific triggers), CPU usage will spike significantly for a few seconds.
    *   **Mitigation:** All intensive processing will be run with low-priority threading to ensure it never interferes with the user's primary tasks. The <1% claim is accurate when averaged over an hour, which is a fair representation.

### 3.2. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk ID | Risk Description                                                                                             | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **T-01**  | **Model Accuracy & False Positives:** The AI model incorrectly flags an employee for burnout or stress, causing anxiety and eroding trust in the system. | Medium      | High   | 1. **Human-in-the-Loop Fine-Tuning:** Use the 3-month pilot phase to gather feedback on predictions and retrain the model to reduce false positives. <br> 2. **Confidence Thresholds:** Only surface insights that meet a high confidence score (>90%). <br> 3. **Focus on Trends, Not Events:** Emphasize long-term trends in the personal dashboard rather than single-day "high stress" alerts. |
| **T-02**  | **Cross-Platform Agent Inconsistency:** The agent behaves differently or gathers inconsistent data on Windows, macOS, and Linux, leading to unfair comparisons. | Medium      | High   | 1. **Standardized Data Sources:** Use a cross-platform library like `psutil` for core metrics (CPU, memory). <br> 2. **Abstracted Activity Monitoring:** Instead of deep OS hooks, monitor active window titles and application names, which is more consistent across platforms. <br> 3. **OS-Specific Test Suites:** Maintain separate, comprehensive test suites for each target OS in the CI/CD pipeline. |
| **P-01**  | **Employee Privacy Backlash:** Despite technical safeguards, employees perceive the tool as invasive "spyware," leading to poor adoption and negative publicity. | Medium      | V. High| 1. **Radical Transparency:** The personal dashboard MUST show the employee *exactly* what data is being collected and *exactly* what insights are being generated, with clear explanations. <br> 2. **Opt-in by Default:** The agent should be voluntary (opt-in) wherever possible. <br> 3. **Open Source Core Components:** Consider open-sourcing the local agent's data collection module to build trust. The model can remain proprietary. |
| **S-01**  | **Central Hub Scalability:** The central hub cannot handle the volume of anonymous reports from tens of thousands of agents, leading to data loss or delayed insights. | Low         | Medium | 1. **Asynchronous Ingestion:** Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) to decouple data ingestion from processing. This allows the system to handle massive traffic spikes. <br> 2. **Time-Series Database:** Use a database optimized for this data type, like TimescaleDB or InfluxDB, for efficient storage and querying. <br> 3. **Stateless Backend:** Design the backend API to be stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling. |

## 5. Detailed Implementation Plan & Roadmap

This section breaks down the project into a granular, actionable engineering plan, including API specifications, development epics, user stories, and a timeline.

This section provides a granular, phased roadmap for the project, from initial research and development to a full market-ready product.

### 5.1. API Specification: Agent-to-Hub Communication

The communication between the local agent and the central hub is designed to be secure, anonymous, and efficient.

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /v1/report/anonymous`
*   **Authentication:** An organization-specific API Key included in the request header.
*   **Security:** All communication must be over HTTPS (TLS 1.3). The payload itself is additionally encrypted using a public key provisioned to the agent, ensuring only the server can read the contents.
*   **Request Body (Outer Envelope):**
    ```json
    {
      "agent_id": "a-unique-anonymous-agent-guid",
      "org_id": "customer-organization-id",
      "timestamp_utc": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z",
      "agent_version": "1.0.0",
      "payload": "<encrypted_blob_containing_metrics>"
    }
    ```
*   **Encrypted Blob Content (After server-side decryption):**
    ```json
    {
      "schema_version": "1.0",
      "metrics": [
        { "name": "focus_session_length_minutes", "value": 45, "department": "engineering" },
        { "name": "break_frequency_per_hour", "value": 1.5, "department": "engineering" },
        { "name": "after_hours_activity_minutes", "value": 30, "department": "engineering" },
        { "name": "communication_sentiment_score", "value": 0.75, "department": "engineering" }
      ]
    }
    ```
    **Critical Privacy Architecture:** The `agent_id` is used only for rate-limiting and abuse prevention at the network edge and is immediately discarded. The decrypted `payload` containing metrics is processed without any link to the agent that sent it, ensuring true anonymity.

### 5.2. Phase 1: Foundation Building & MVP (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** Develop the core components and validate the fundamental technology choices.

## 6. Conclusion

This section summarizes the key findings of the technical plan and reaffirms the path forward.

This technical implementation plan provides a comprehensive blueprint for developing the AI-Powered Employee Wellbeing Monitoring System. The analysis confirms that the project is technically feasible, with the revised **<150MB installation footprint** being a key enabler. The proposed technology stack, centered on a quantized **Phi-3-mini model** and a **Python-based agent**, offers a robust and scalable foundation.

The primary risks identified are not purely technical but lie in ensuring **model accuracy** and navigating the **employee privacy landscape**. The mitigation strategies—focusing on radical transparency, human-in-the-loop feedback, and a privacy-first API architecture—are therefore critical to the project's success.

The phased implementation roadmap provides a clear, actionable path from initial R&D to a full-scale commercial launch.
